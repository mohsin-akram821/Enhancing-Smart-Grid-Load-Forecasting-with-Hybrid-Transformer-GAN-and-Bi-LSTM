# Enhancing-Smart-Grid-Load-Forecasting-with-Hybrid-Transformer-GAN-and-Bi-LSTM
We propose a hybrid STLF framework combining TTS-GAN for synthetic data generation and Bi-LSTM for forecasting. On the Johor dataset, it achieves MAPE of 0.096 (1h-ahead) and 2.560 (1d-ahead), surpassing baselines. SHAP and LIME ensure interpretability and trust.
